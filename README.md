Tic-Tac-Toe holds a special place in my coding journey as it marks my very first project. My coding journey kicked off with CS50, where I got my first taste of programming. While the assignments were great, I was itching to create something of my own. So, I began with simple commands on the computer and slowly learned to create a sleek-looking game board. Along the way, I learned a ton about breaking down big tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This process not only honed my coding skills but also fueled my passion for creating and problem-solving.
